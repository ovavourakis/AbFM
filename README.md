## Installation

```bash
# Conda environment with dependencies.
conda env create -f fm.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate fm

# Manually need to install torch-scatter...
pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.0.0+cu117.html
# ... as well as blobb_structure_checking.
conda install -c bioconda "biobb_structure_checking>=3.13.4"

# Install local package.
# Current directory should be protein-frame-flow/
pip install -e .
```

For more information on `blobb_structure_checking` look at the [repo](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_structure_checking, and the [documentation](https://biobb-structure-checking.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_usage.html).

Our training relies on logging with wandb. Log in to Wandb and make an account.

## Data

Download preprocessed SCOPe dataset (~280MB) hosted on dropbox: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b8l0bqowi96hl21ycsmht/preprocessed_scope.tar.gz?rlkey=0h7uulr7ioyvzlap6a0rwpx0n&dl=0).

Other datasets are also possible to train on using the `data/process_pdb_files.py` script.
However, we currently do not support other datasets.

```bash
# Expand tar file.
tar -xvzf preprocessed_scope.tar.gz
rm preprocessed_scope.tar.gz
```
Your directory should now look like this 
```
├── analysis
├── build
├── configs
├── data
├── experiments
├── media
├── models
├── openfold
├── preprocessed
└── weights
```

## Training

By default the code uses 2 GPUs with DDP and runs for 200 epochs.
We used 2 A6000 40GB GPUs on which training took ~2 days.
Following our paper, we train on SCOPe up to length 128.

```bash
python -W ignore experiments/train_se3_flows.py
```

## Inference

### Download weights

The published weights are hosted on dropbox: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/r8i0o057b0ms71ep5bf4m/published.ckpt?rlkey=pygthp5qjpwkn4glmai48mgy7&dl=0).
Download the checkpoint and place in the weights subdirectory.

```
weights
├── config.yaml
└── published.ckpt
```

### Run inference

Our inference script allows for DDP. By default we sample 10 sequences per
length between 60 and 128. Samples are stored as PDB files as well as the
trajectories. We do not include evaluation code using ProteinMPNN and ESMFold
but this should be easy to set-up if one looks at the [FrameDiff codebase](https://github.com/jasonkyuyim/se3_diffusion).

```bash
python -W ignore experiments/inference_se3_flows.py
```

# Responsible AI FAQ
- What is FrameFlow?
  - FrameFlow is a deep neural network that models 3D protein structures.
- What can FrameFlow do?
  - By sampling from FrameFlow, you can obtain a description of the positions and orientations of the backbone atoms in a protein.
- What is/are FrameFlow’s intended use(s)?
  - FrameFlow is intended for research purposes only, for the machine learning for structural biology community.
- How was FrameFlow evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?
  - FrameFlow was evaluated on how novel, designable and diverse the protein structures sampled from FrameFlow were. 
- What are the limitations of FrameFlow? How can users minimize the impact of FrameFlow’s limitations when using the system?
  - FrameFlow has not been tested by real-world experiments to see if the proteins it samples are actually designable. FrameFlow should be used for research purposes only.
- What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of FrameFlow?
  - FrameFlow should be used for research purposes only.
